# The Odin Project Web Development 101

## Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

This is my first **HTML/CSS/JS** project. **Live version** of the game is [here](https://ajclay7.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/).

### First stage | Game in the browser console

**The benefits I got from this stage:**

- Deepened knowledge of how **functions work** with each other
- Understand how to structure a small project

### Second stage | Game with added UI

**The benefits I got from this stage:**

- Learned to use and modify **[Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/)**.
- Deepened knowledge of **CSS**
- Learned basic **manipulations of elements styles** through JavaScript code (setting attributes, adding/removing classes, changing inline styles and texts).
- Improved my **understanding of JavaScript functions** (organization, workspaces, scopes, calling, invoking, breaking down into smaller ones..).

### Summary

- The game is **fully playable** in the browser window.
- I really tried to keep **readable and understandable code**, **short functions**, and **descriptive names**
